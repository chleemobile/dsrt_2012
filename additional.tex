\section {Additional Application}

Airports often use simulation of arrivals and departures to evaluate operations. Depending on
the runway layout of the airport, time of day, and the state of airplanes arriving and departing,
different priorities may be given to landing aircraft and planes waiting to take off. The simulation
could be used to predict changes in operation under adverse weather conditions and varying
types of aircraft. One last application may simulate the grounding of all flights in the event of a
national disaster such as 9/11. It would be of great interest to evaluate different strategies to find
the quickest way to land all airborne aircraft at the same time. Of course, the accuracy of any air traffic simulation is as good as it the rules it uses.
Creating an accurate simulation that provides the most meaningful results relies on the use of accurate flight rules,
and providing detailed state variables that must be considered when flying.

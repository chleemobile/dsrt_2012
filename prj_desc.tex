\section{Project Description}

Implementing parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) \cite{fujpar} has never been an easy task. There
are many well known problems that come from the nature of parallelism such as managing
concurrent threads execution or Heisenbugs, however, the major problem of implementing
PDES is synchronization. In PDES, events are not synchronized by a global clock but rather
scheduled irregularly. This introduces the necessity of a rollback mechanism in PDES.

Backstroke \cite{vulthe} is a new open source framework for the automatic generation of reverse code for
functions written in C++. Because writing an efficient rollback by hand is difficult, the primary
purpose of Backstroke is to enable reverse computation for fast, efficient rollback in optimistic
parallel discrete event simulation.  In this project, weâ€™d like to benchmark the performance of the reverse code generation using
Backstroke and evaluate how it can affect on the simulation performance in terms of time and
space-wise compared to the hand-written code.

This project consists of two parts. First part is to create a parallel discrete event simulation using
Time Warp as the synchronization mechanism on ROSS \cite{carros}. Second part is to benchmark the
simulation performance between the hand-written code and Backstroke-generated code.

Despite the significant evolution of mobile devices and increasing the
usage of mobile devices, not many mobile benchmarks have been
studied. Even though mobile applications share similar characteristics
with traditional desktop oriented applications, different programming
environments and user usage patterns present different
characteristics. In this paper, we introduce an open source based mobile
multimedia benchmarks for android platforms (AM-Bench). The AM-Bench
consists of several multimedia benchmarks running on Android
platforms. We explain the characteristics of the AM-Bench and
compare performance on four Android based platforms.
